[section TR1]

The so called "Technical Report 1", or TR1 for short, is an addition to the C++ standard library.
All modern compilers do implement this extension, and that's why fcppt makes use of it.
However, it is not portable across compilers which headers the user must include to access
the tr1 features.
For gcc they reside in "<tr1/header>", but in "<header>" for VC++.
Therefore fcppt provides wrappers around those headers that include the right one.
All of them are located in 'fcppt/tr1' and have the 'hpp' suffix.

[section Example]

Here is a quick examples showing some tr1 features.
