[section Threads]

fcppt provides a wrapper around 'boost::thread'.
The new thread class asserts that it has been joined upon
destruction.
If the assertion is violated, `std::terminate` will be called.
Most of the functions of the boost::thread class are wrapped,
however, boost::this_thread and the future classes are not.
