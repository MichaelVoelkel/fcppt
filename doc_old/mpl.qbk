[section MPL]

fcppt's mpl library consists of some meta functions
and runtime functions considered
general enough, that they might be useful.

[section for_each]

The most important addition to mpl is `fcppt::mpl::for_each` that
doesn't construct the types it iterates over.
This makes it possible to iterate over types that cannot be constructed,
for example an abstract base class.
