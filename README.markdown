About
-----

Freundlich's C++ Toolkit (fcppt) is a collection of libraries focusing on
improving general C++ code by providing better types, a strong focus on C++11
(non-conforming compilers are mostly not supported) and functional programming
(which is both efficient and syntactically affordable in C++11).
